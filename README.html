        <h1 id="fuzzy-s-bbq-menu-component">Fuzzy&#39;s BBQ Menu Component</h1>
<p>A simple React app that fetches some local JSON data which contains menu items. This was made to look as close to the design as possible, and with a flexible, and responsive skeleton. This is testable with various sizes of data, and built to be as responsive as possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run">How To Run</h2>
<p>Simply <code>git clone</code>, <code>cd</code> to the directory, <code>npm install</code>, <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should Redux be introduced into this mini-application?</p>
<ul>
<li>I certainly <em>thought</em> about it, but since this was on such a small scale, I stuck with regular ol&#39; React. Had this been a bigger scale project where state management becomes a problem, then my approach would&#39;ve been to introduce Redux.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding as to how I get the menu data, I do it via <code>fetch</code>. I originally had problems with keeping it inside the <code>src</code> folder, but that didn&#39;t work. Moving the JSON file out to the <code>public</code> folder proved successful, however. That said, if this were to accept a different API URL, then simply changing the argument in <code>this.getItems()</code> under <code>componentDidMount()</code> will work, provided that the structure in the README is the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Flexible Skeleton</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve included a few JSON files under the <code>public</code> folder. There are three files that vary in sizes: small, medium and large. Just change the file path variable in the <code>getItems()</code> function under <code>componentDidMount()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
